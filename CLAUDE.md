# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A motion graphics editor for product showcases (Apple-style launches, SaaS explainers), fully
usable by hand, with an optional AI assistant that edits through MCP. English and Bangla.
The Cargo workspace has one app:

- **`studio/`** (binary `ai-video-studio`, "AI Video Studio", Iced 0.14 + wgpu). The original egui
  app that used to live at the repo root, and the throwaway `spikes/iced-ui/` prototype that picked
  Iced, were both removed (they're in git history if ever needed).

README.md is the user-facing setup guide (Windows + Linux), feature list and shortcuts — keep it
in sync when adding features, shortcuts, env vars or file locations.

## Working rules

- **Never `git commit`** (or push) — the user makes all commits. Read-only git is fine.
- The project is built on **both Windows (GNU toolchain) and Linux** — changes must compile on
  both, and Windows behavior must not change when fixing Linux. OS-specific code goes in
  `studio/src/platform.rs` or behind `#[cfg(windows)]` / `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`.
- The user's own running app owns MCP port 47822. Test instances must use another port:
  `AIVE_STUDIO_MCP_PORT=47950`.
- Don't drive the user's Claude account (live assistant chats) without asking.
- UI must look premium: every color/size/font comes from `ui/tokens.rs`; check new UI visually
  with the debug snapshot below (not desktop screenshots — they capture the user's other windows).

## Commands

```sh
cargo run -p studio --release                    # start screen
cargo run -p studio --release -- path/to/x.aivp  # open a project
cargo test -p studio                             # unit + FFmpeg/GPU integration tests
cargo test -p studio range_volume                # tests matching a name
cargo build -p studio --release                  # release build check
```

Tests generate fixtures with real FFmpeg, so it must be findable (lookup in `studio/src/ffmpeg.rs`:
`AIVE_FFMPEG_DIR`, `ffmpeg/` next to the exe, next to the exe, workspace `vendor/ffmpeg/`, `PATH`).
Linux needs `libasound2-dev`. Studio doesn't depend on `ring`, so Windows needs only the Rust
GNU toolchain + MinGW-w64 (WinLibs). Windows packaging:
`scripts\package-studio.ps1`; Linux: `scripts/package-studio.sh`.

### Debug snapshots (debug builds only)

`cargo run -p studio -- project.aivp` with these env vars renders the real window to a PNG and exits:
`STUDIO_SNAPSHOT=out.png`, `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_DELAY` (seconds), `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_TIME` (playhead),
`STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_SCROLL`, `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_SELECT=clip[,a,b]` (select a clip, optionally mark a range),
`STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_OPEN=ai|assistant|effects|settings|skills|shortcuts|confirm|export` (open the Connect AI dialog, the
assistant panel, the Effects tab, Settings, the assistant's Skills manager, the Keyboard shortcuts dialog, the
unsaved-changes confirm dialog, or the Export dialog), `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_ZOOM=2` (preview zoom), `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_CHAT=reply.md` (a sample
conversation with that Markdown reply, no AI needed), `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_REOPEN=1` (switch to the
assistant tab last), `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_SEEK=seconds` (move the playhead), `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_TEXT=start,end` (select those characters in, or `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_TYPE=text` to type at the end of,
the text box of a text clip selected with `STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_SELECT`). Set `APPDATA` to a scratch folder for test instances so they don't touch the
user's settings or recent projects.
Wired through `Message::Snapshot` / `DevSelect` in `editor/mod.rs`, all `cfg(debug_assertions)`.

## Studio architecture (`studio/src`)

**Document model.** `model.rs` (Project, Asset, Track with optional `height`, Canvas; saved as
`.aivp` JSON) and `clip.rs` (Clip with transform, look — corners/border/shadow, grade, audio with
fades and range `gains`, Camtasia-style `zooms` where `camera_at` pans between adjacent zooms,
keyframes, intro/outro motions, transitions, text (with `spans`: styled character ranges — change the text only
through `TextLayer::set_text` and styles through `style_range`, which keep spans on their words), shape and blur layers (`Content::Blur`: a box that blurs
the media below it while the clip is on), `crop`, and `part` — Whole, or Picture/Sound after "Separate audio"; use
`Project::clip_kind`, `clip_has_picture`, `clip_has_sound` instead of the asset kind). Timeline
`markers` live on the Project (colored points or spans; not rendered). Positions are canvas
fractions; lengths are "canvas units" (px at a 1080 short side). Types derive `PartialEq`.

**All edits are methods in `edit.rs`, run through `doc.rs`.** `Doc::apply` / `apply_merge` clone
the project, run the edit on the draft, and only commit if it succeeded *and* changed something
(no-op edits make no undo step and don't dirty the project). `apply_merge` with a key coalesces
slider drags/typing within 900 ms. `next_id` never goes backwards across undo/redo because caches
are keyed by ids. Edit invariants: clips never overlap on a track; new clips keep their time and
go to a free (or new) track; locked tracks reject edits (`ensure_unlocked`); trim drops zooms/gains
outside the clip; `set_speed` ripples following clips and rescales zooms/gains/keyframes.
UI, MCP tools and tests all go through `Doc` — never mutate the project directly.

**One renderer for preview and export.** `render/scene.rs::evaluate(project, t, size, sources)`
→ `LayerSpec`s; `render/compositor.rs` + `layer.wgsl` (wgpu; SDF shapes, gradients, corners,
shadows) draws them inside iced's render pass for the preview (`editor/preview.rs`) and headless
for export/snapshots (`render/export.rs::Offscreen`). A new visual effect must go through scene +
compositor to appear anywhere. Crop shrinks the layer and its `uv`; zooms work inside the crop; a blur
clip adds no pixels: `scene::evaluate` maps its box onto each media layer below it (through rotation,
crop and zoom) as per-layer blur regions (up to 4; 9×9 Gaussian in `layer.wgsl`) and keeps an
invisible layer for picking. A mask clip (`Content::Mask`) works the same way but restricts
visibility instead of blurring: `scene::evaluate` maps its box onto each media layer below as
per-layer mask regions (up to 4, feathered, optionally inverted to hide the box instead of
showing only it) — keyframe the mask clip's X/Y (the same general per-clip keyframe system) to
have it follow a moving subject by hand; there's no automatic tracking. The
per-layer uniform is 464 bytes (stride 512) and carries a `view` transform: the preview can be
zoomed past its pane, so `preview.rs` draws only the visible part of the canvas rectangle. Color grading
(`clip::Grade`) is brightness/contrast/saturation/temperature plus a lift/gamma/gain three-way (shadows/mids/
highlights), applied in `layer.wgsl::apply_grade` from the per-layer `grade`/`grade2` uniforms. `render/frames.rs` (FrameServer) runs one FFmpeg decoder per
visible clip and caches images; `render/text.rs` rasterizes with cosmic-text (Bangla shaping);
`render/audio.rs::mix_graph` builds the FFmpeg audio mix used by export and playback, including each clip's
EQ (`clip::Eq`, three fixed-band `equalizer` filters), compressor (`clip::Compressor`, `acompressor`) and
denoise (`afftdn`), and — export only — a final `loudnorm` pass when `ExportSettings.loudness` is set.
`playback.rs` plays audio with cpal; the audio clock is the master clock.

**Editor UI** (`editor/`): `mod.rs` holds `Editor`, its `Message`s, keyboard shortcuts, dialogs,
autosave (2 s) and the timeline layout; `timeline.rs` (ruler, lanes, zoom bands, volume envelope),
`inspector.rs` (`Edit` enum → edits; `HexDraft` color inputs), `canvas_overlay.rs`
(select/move/scale/rotate, zoom-focus editing), `library.rs` (media/text/shape/effect/sound
presets), `assistant_panel.rs`, `export_dialog.rs` (delivery presets — Web/YouTube/Social/Archive/Custom,
via `render::export::Preset` — cap resolution, audio bitrate and loudness target; "Also as …" queues
further presets to export as a batch after the current one), `media_cache.rs` (thumbnails, filmstrips,
waveforms). `ui/` is the design system: `tokens.rs`, `style.rs`, `widgets.rs`, Lucide `icons.rs`,
`chrome.rs` (frameless title bar, motion logo). `icon.rs` rasterizes the same logo with plain std: the window icon, `build.rs` (embeds a
`.ico` in the Windows exe through `windres`/`rc.exe`) and `--write-icons DIR` (packaging) all use it.
Right-clicks on the lanes and the preview select what's under the cursor, then one `context_menu()`
serves both; it also has **Copy color / Paste color** (`Editor::color_clipboard`, a single `Grade`)
to carry a clip's whole color grade over to others via `Doc::set_grade`. The inspector takes an
`inspector::Ctx` (edit modes, range, collapsed sections, search); every section goes through
`ctx.section(...)` so search and collapse work. Library effects are `library::Effect`s: click
applies to the selection, drag drops on a clip (`Message::DropEffect`) — except `Effect::Transition`,
which targets the seam between two touching clips instead of a clip's body (`timeline::Lanes::seam_hit`
for the drop, `transition_hit` for the resize handle the applied transition shows at its leading edge).
Packaging: `scripts/package-studio.ps1` (Windows) and `scripts/package-studio.sh` (Linux). The window never draws its own frame; on Windows
it gets native rounded corners/shadow.

**AI.** `mcp.rs` serves MCP (JSON-RPC over `tiny_http`) on the first free port from 47822
(`AIVE_STUDIO_MCP_PORT`), local origins only; calls reach the UI thread through a subscription and
answer on a reply channel. Tools live in `editor/tools.rs` (schema + handler per tool) — adding a
tool means adding both there. `assistant.rs` runs the user's `claude` CLI headless against that
server (enabled only when connected). Each Claude Code process has its own inbox (a stopped one can't
leak events into the next reply), runs in a `platform::ProcessGroup` (Windows job object / Linux process
group, so Stop ends everything it started), and tags its MCP requests with `X-Aive-Run`; the editor
refuses tool calls whose run isn't the reply in progress (`Agent::accepts`). Every reply ends in
exactly one `TurnDone`, and the UI closes it through `end_chat_turn`; `ai_connect.rs` is the Connect AI dialog and title-bar chip;
the chosen provider persists in `settings.rs`. ChatGPT runs OpenAI's Codex CLI (`codex exec --json`, one
process per reply, `exec resume <thread>` to continue; settings as `-c key='value'` TOML literal strings so
nothing needs double quotes through `cmd /C`; the run tag goes in the MCP URL as `?run=`). `codex_status`
checks install + `codex login status`; `codex_sign_in` runs `codex login` (browser). Tests use fake
`claude`/`codex` scripts — never the user's accounts. The Codex flags come from the docs, not a live run:
verify them (`codex exec --help`) when Codex is available.

**Settings dialog.** `settings_dialog.rs` edits `settings::Prefs` (preview quality with Auto, UI
scale via `App::scale_factor`, snapping/mute defaults, default still length, autosave interval,
export quality, projects folder); `Editor::apply_prefs` applies them. Auto quality steps down while
`FrameServer::take_lag` reports late frames during playback and resets when playback stops.
The audio mix must keep `apad=whole_dur=…`: an unbounded `apad` makes long exports crawl.

**Other modules.** `settings.rs` (recent projects, layout, AI provider; `%APPDATA%\AIVideoEditor\studio.json`
/ `~/.config/ai-video-editor/studio.json`; projects default to `~/Videos/AI Video Editor`),
`sfx.rs` (9 synthesized sounds written to the config dir), `fonts.rs` (bundled Inter, Poppins,
Hind Siliguri), `ffmpeg.rs`, `platform.rs` (reveal/open in file manager), `main.rs` (on Linux,
removes `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` to run under XWayland so drag and drop works — winit has no Wayland DnD;
`STUDIO_WAYLAND=1` opts out), `shortcuts_dialog.rs` (read-only keyboard shortcuts reference, a
modal layer in `App` like the Settings/Connect AI dialogs), `sample.rs` (`demo_project`: the
"Try an example project" starter scene offered on the start screen, built from text/shape/callout
clips so it needs no bundled media).

**Unsaved changes.** `App::confirm` (a `PendingAction`) gates New/Close/Open/Quit on
`doc.is_dirty()`: a dialog offers Save, Don't save (reverts to the last saved file via
`Project::load`, or is a no-op if never saved) or Cancel before any of them proceeds. `persist()`
surfaces a save failure as the error banner instead of discarding the change silently.

## Gotchas

- Iced draws images above meshes within one layer — stack separate canvases to layer them
  (the timeline is `LanesBase` + `Lanes`). Stacked layers escape a scrollable's clipping, and
  images/text aren't clipped to canvas bounds, so clip manually (`on_canvas`).
- Canvas `with_clip` keeps absolute coordinates.
- `container(..).clip(true)` only narrows the viewport its children get; their backgrounds and borders still
  draw outside it. Use `widgets::clipped` (a real clip layer that also hides the mouse outside) when content can
  move past its bounds (the track headers scroll that way).
- Keep the widget tree's shape stable: iced matches widget state (scroll offsets, text cursors) by
  position, so wrapping the window in a `stack` only while something is shown rebuilds every panel and
  resets their scrolling. `App::view` always stacks the same layers (`space()` when empty); do the same
  for new overlays.
- FFmpeg filter-script files must outlive the FFmpeg process that reads them. Use
  `ffmpeg::filter_script_option()` (FFmpeg 7 `-/filter_complex` vs 6.x `-filter_complex_script`).
- Export writes through a cleanup guard so a cancelled/failed export leaves no partial file.
- cosmic-text's `SwashCache::with_pixels` discards a glyph color's alpha channel, replacing it with
  the glyph's own coverage/anti-aliasing mask (`Color((coverage << 24) | base.0 & 0xFF_FFFF)` in
  their source) — setting alpha via `Attrs::color()` has no visible effect. Per-word fade (the
  kinetic text reveal, `render/text.rs`) instead packs a word index alongside the existing
  style-span index into one `Attrs::metadata()` value (`pack_word_meta`/`unpack_style`/
  `unpack_word`), builds word bounding boxes from the laid-out glyphs, and multiplies alpha by
  position inside the `buffer.draw` callback, after coverage is known.
